To play the game by yourself, select the **Manual** algorithm.

Next, you will be presented the maze.  
The red dot represents your character, it spawns on the starting point, a green cell.
The objective is to step on the arrival point, a blue cell.

Grey cells are walls. They do what walls do :)  
Brown cells are mud, they slow the character when walked on.  
Red cells are traps, they kill the character when stepped on.
